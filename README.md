# Question

A hotel has N number of rooms. Create a list of rooms in the hotel such that

Each room in your rooms list needs to contain at least 5 items (ie, TV, couch, table, Air Conditioner etc) and the relative dollar value of each item.

It should provide us with an interactive command prompt based shell with the following menu.

1. Add a hotel
2. Add a room to the hotel with any of the 5 items.
3. Print out each room along with the individual items and values. This needs to be properly formatted, eg: no printing an object as is
4. Accept a budget from the user(in $) and list only those rooms which will cost less than or equal to his budget.

# How To Run
